### Phil Ting

Assemblymember Phil Ting isn't super strong on tech, but he has done a couple
notable things. Most relevant to the tech industry, and general innovation, is
that he [tried to legalize UberPool and Lyft Line](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1360&search_keywords=).
Yes, _really_, shared rides were [deemed illegal in California back in 2014](https://www.cnet.com/news/california-deems-all-ride-share-carpooling-services-illegal/).
Assemblymember Ting attempted to pass [AB 1360](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-tnc-carpooling-20150420-story.html)
to legalize it, although it was killed by a State Senator
[with family ties to the Taxi business](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-ben-hueso-taxi-industry-uber-lyft-20160311-story.html).
Shared carpooling wasn't made legal until 2016, when the California Public
Utilities Commission [updated their 50-year old rules](https://fortune.com/2016/04/21/california-uber-lyft-carpool/).

This highlights one of the many things wrong with California: despite fostering
the most innovation industry in the world, our government is inherently
conservative and defaults to saying No to new ideas. Our legislators are too
often captured by legacy business interests and do everything they can to stop
change.

In addition to rideshare, in 2015 Assemblymember Ting introduced legislation to
[encourage open datasets for the California state government](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1215&search_keywords=).
Unfortunately, this died before getting to a vote.

Phil Ting [voted in favor of AB5](https://legiscan.com/CA/rollcall/AB5/id/890318),
which limits how many gigs someone can work. It has been widely panned as
anti-worker. We think AB5 is fundamentally flawed, but that Ting's positives
outweight the negatives.

Assemblymember Phil Ting is running unopposed.
