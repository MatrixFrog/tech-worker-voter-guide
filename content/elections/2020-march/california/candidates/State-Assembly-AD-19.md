### Phil Ting

Assemblymember Phil Ting isn't super strong on tech, but he has done a couple
notable things. Most relevant to the tech industry, and general innovation, is
that he [legalized UberPool and Lyft Line](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1360&search_keywords=).
Yes, really, this was illegal in California and we had to legalize it in 2015.
This highlights one of the many things wrong with California: despite fostering
the most innovation industry in the world, our government is inherently
conservative and defaults to saying No to new ideas.

In addition to that, in 2015 Assemblymember Ting introduced legislation to
[encourage open datasets for the California state government](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1215&search_keywords=).
Unfortunately, this died before getting to a vote.
