### David Chiu

Incumbent Assemblymember David Chiu has been an ally for tech for at least a
decade. In addition to voting in favor of the [mid-market tax incentive](https://www.sfgate.com/technology/dotcommentary/article/David-Chiu-wants-to-be-S-F-s-techie-mayor-2298885.php#)
for tech companies, (aka the "Twitter Tax Break"), when Assemblymember Chiu was
a San Francisco Supervisor, he [created San Francsico's open data portal](https://www.govtech.com/dc/articles/SF-Mayor-Signs-Landmark-Open-Data-Policy-and-Procedures-Legislation.html),
known as [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/). Because of him, San Francisco's
open data policy is one of the best in the nation.

Assemblymember Chiu's background is in the tech industry. As a private citizen,
founded Grassroots Enterprise, an online communications company that focused
on political causes. He was COO until resigning to run for office.

As a child of immigrants and a former small business owner, Assemblymember Chiu
has the personal experience and knowledge to represent the tech industry well.
