### Vote NO

This tax on vacant commercial properties is supposed to help solve our retail
vacancy problem. However, this tax won't address the reason there are so many
vacant storefronts: a highly restrictive planning code, burdensome fees, and
already high taxes.

Property owners _like_ money. Nobody is intentionally refusing to rent a retail
space because they think they'll make more money by holding it off the market.
The loss an owner takes from just a single month of missed rent could take
years to recoup. A new tax is unlikely to change these economics.

At best, this will incentivize a few owners to lease their property at a lower
rent rather than pay the tax. But we should make it easier to open new
businesses instead of punishing people who are already overburdened by bad
city rules.

This satisfies [#Good Government.Bureaucracy]({{< relref "/framework" >}}#Good%20Government.Bureaucracy),
but violates [#Taxation.New Taxes]({{< relref "/framework" >}}#Taxation.New%20Taxes),
from our voting framework.

### What is it?

San Francisco has a lot of vacant storefronts. This doesn’t make a whole lot of
sense in such a strong economy, but nevertheless it’s true. In some
neighborhoods, such as Castro and North Beach, the percentage of vacant
storefronts is in the double digits, threatening the vitality of the remaining
small businesses and the neighborhood as a whole. This ballot prop seeks to
address the problem by imposing a tax on vacant storefronts. The tax starts at
$250/year per foot of street frontage in the first year of vacancy, rising to
$500 in year 2, and $1000 in years 3 and beyond.

The type of vacancy this tax is intended to address is the case of landlords
intentionally holding storefronts vacant. This does happen on occasion, because
[Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13) freezes
property tax assessments to the last sale price. This means that a lot of
property owners are paying tax bills from decades ago, as far back as 1975,
which makes it rather cheap to hold out for a super high-paying tenant.

While this tax could help for some cases of bad-actor landlords, its impact
will be limited, because landlord greed is not the main reason for vacant
storefronts. Most landlords, it turns out, like money. The main factor driving
commercial vacancy is the City. Many of the most struggling commercial
corridors impose hyper-restrictive controls on the types of businesses that are
allowed to open, requiring restaurants and bars to go through the arduous,
risky, and expensive conditional use process. And once the business gets open,
the city forces them through a [ringer of taxes, fees, and mandates](https://www.kqed.org/perspectives/201601139229/fees-taxes-red-tape).
There’s a reason Arizona State University ranked San Francisco as the [worst
American city](https://dbna.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2019-10/1%20ASU%20DBNA%202019%20Report%20Full.pdf)
for doing business.

There’s more than a tinge of irony in this ballot prop coming from District 3
Supervisor Aaron Peskin. Nobody in San Francisco has done more work to promote
commercial vacancy than Aaron Peskin. Aaron Peskin thinks Kafka wrote how-to
guides. When he first entered office in 2000, the Planning Code was lean and
coherent. Now it’s such a sprawling mess the former Zoning Administrator [called
it insane](https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=6&clip_id=34501&starttime=5030)
and quit. In his home neighborhood of North Beach, he thought that a good
approach to reducing commercial vacancies is to ban restaurants in nearly [80%
of vacant storefronts](https://www.northbeachneighbors.org/open-for-business).
In early 2019 he attempted to [shut down the Planning
Department](https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/Peskin-s-bill-is-San-Francisco-s-attempt-to-13618207.php#)
by requiring extensive review for routine home remodels. He designed the chain
store ban, intended to restrict big box retailers, to cover small businesses
with as few as 11 locations. Every time you read about another small business
horror story, there’s a good chance it’s a product of the laws and processes
Aaron Peskin has worked so hard to enact and preserve.

In fact, this measure itself contains a good amount of what one might term
Peskinism. First, if there’s a tenant, it holds the tenant responsible for
paying the tax, which certainly is a poor way to go after landlords! And while
the text says that businesses are exempt from the tax during the building
permit application period, earlier in the measure, “building permit application
period” is defined to be no more than a year. One year is not enough time to
make it through the glacially slow Peskin permitting process. In this [Small
Business Commission hearing](https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=45&clip_id=34393&starttime=8604),
legislation author Lee Hepner suggested using the revenue from the tax to
compensate small business owners forced to pay the tax due to the city’s
dilly-dallying. Why not just not charge small businesses  in the first place?

Overall, on balance, while this tax will help around the edges with a few
recalcitrant landlords, its impact will be muted by City Hall’s hostility
towards small business, and in the worst cases, will force small businesses to
pay a tax through no fault of their own, but rather of the city.

### Why is it on the ballot?

[Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13)
mandates that all new taxes be subjected to a vote of the public and achieve
a 2/3 majority.
