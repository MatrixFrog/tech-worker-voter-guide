#### Vote NO

Prop E will prevent new office development in the city, driving up the cost
of office space and driving _out_ startups. On the surface it looks like it
will help build low income housing, but in reality it will cause both housing
and office development to stop.

Kim-Mai Cutler does a great job explaining why this is a terrible prop:

#### What is it?

Prop E is a complicated proposal related to office space development. The way
it works is that San Francisco has an annual cap on how much new office space
is allowed to be built. We also have goals from the state for how much
subsidized affordable housing we should build for low-income households (we
never make it). Prop E would limit the office space proportionally based how
how much we fail to meet our housing goals. If we only meet 20% of our
affordable housing goal, the office space cap will be 20% of the standard cap.
Current projects in the pipeline, however, related to the Central Soma Plan,
are exempted from the cap altogether. The reason is to prevent those developers
from funding an opposition campaign.

Prop E sounds kinda nice on the surface. We do need a lot more affordable
housing! However, it does absolutely nothing to build any affordable housing.
It does not raise any money, which is the binding constraint on how much
affordable housing we can build. In fact, over time it will lose us money,
because office building pay a lot of taxes, provided they exist. The Office of
Economic and Workforce Development [has estimated](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/SF-voters-to-consider-new-limits-to-office-growth-14893911.php)
that over 20 years, the measure would reduce affordable housing funding by
$600-$900 million. That’s 2-3000 units.

Prop E represents yet another battlefront in San Francisco’s self-defeating war
on tech. The logic goes as follows: tech companies rent offices. If we make it
really hard to build office space, then the tech companies will go away and San
Francisco will go back to being like it used to be.

The past 40 years of San Francisco history have proven this idea false. San
Francisco is growing because a lot of people and companies want to be here. If
we fail to accommodate that growth, people don’t stop wanting to live in
SF--instead what happens is that the people (and firms) with more resources
push out those with less. That is what has happened in our housing market, and
that is what will happen to the business environment if this ballot prop
passes. Big tech companies won’t be much dissuaded by high rents, but
nonprofits, small businesses, and early stage startups will. 

In summary, this measure would harm affordable housing production while
hollowing out the middle of SF’s business community. There are no benefits.
Please vote no.

#### Why is it on the ballot?

Prop E was put directly onto the ballot by signatures gathered from SF voters.
Regardless of its origin, it also requires a vote because it modifies
[Prop M from 1986](https://www.spur.org/publications/urbanist-article/1999-07-01/proposition-m-and-downtown-growth-battle),
which was the first ballot prop to limit office space construction in San
Francisco.

Nonprofit landlord Todco has spent $407,000 so far to collect the signatures
and run the campaign. Todco is [using taxpayer dollars to fund political
opposition to new housing](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Pre-election-opening-for-Warm-Springs-BART-looks-9981990.php)
and office construction.

It's _technically_ legally but morally abhorrent to
use money intended for low-income residents to stop new construction. They've
been doing this for decades.
