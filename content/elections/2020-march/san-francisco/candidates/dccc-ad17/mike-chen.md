A tech job brought me to San Francisco, and I fell in love with the city. Tech
has brought many jobs and opportunities to the city. Tech can be a force for
good in SF â€“ and SF can influence tech to be better. Tech workers should push
the industry to be more diverse and equitable.

The tech workers I know don't want SF to become a monoculture - they want a
diverse city where folks of all stripes and industries can afford to live. The
tech industry is blamed for housing costs, but the true causes are a
decades-long lack of planning for population and economic growth. We must face
the challenges and opportunities of a growing city. Tech workers should
advocate for a San Francisco that welcomes and houses both transplants and
natives. Tech workers lobby the tech industry to provide more equitable
opportunities for women, black people, and Latino people.
