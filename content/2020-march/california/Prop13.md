### Vote YES

Bonds are an excellent way to fund infrastructure improvements requiring massive
capital. Bonds let us get improvements today and pay for them with future,
inflated money. We also have the benefit of having [very low interest rates](https://california.municipalbonds.com/bonds/yield_curve/).

Funding educational facilities is a great use of public money. We all benefit
when our populace is well educated in good facilities.

This satisfies <a href="{{< relref "/framework" >}}#Taxation.Infrastructure">#Taxation.Infrastructure</a>
from our voting framework.

### What is it?

This year's Prop 13 (not to be confused with the [disastrous 1978 Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13))
authorizes the state to issue a new general obligation bond for $15B which will
be used in the following ways:

* $2.8B for new schools (k-12)
* $5.2B to upgrade & modernize existing school facilities (k-12)
* $500MM for charter school facilities
* $500MM for career technical education facilities (aka job training)
* $2B to California State University for capital outlay financing needs
* $2B to UC Hastings College of Law for capital outlay financing needs
* $2B for capital outlay financing needs for community colleges statewide


### Why is it on the ballot?

[Article XVI](https://ballotpedia.org/Article_XVI,_California_Constitution#Section_1)
of the California Constitution requires any general obligation bonds in excess
of $300,000 be put to a vote. The bond must also be approved by a 2/3 majority
of the state Senate and state Assembly.

This bond has already achieved a 2/3 majority vote in both houses. The final
step is a simple majority vote of the public. Read more at [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_13,_School_and_College_Facilities_Bond_(March_2020)#Path_to_the_ballot)
