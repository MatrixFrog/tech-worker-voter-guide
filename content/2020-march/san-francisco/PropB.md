## Vote YES

Bonds are the preferred way to finance critical infrastructure improvements.
We need to ensure that San Francisco can manage the next large earthquake, and
this bond helps us prepare.

This satisfies [#Taxation.Infrastructure]({{< relref "/framework" >}}#Taxation.Infrastructure)
from our voting framework.

## What is it?

This is a $628.5MM bond to fund construction, acquisition, improvement, renovation, and seismic retrofitting of:
* Emergency Firefighting Water System
* Firefighting facilities
* Police facilities
* 911 Call Center facilities
* Other disaster response facilities and infrastructure

This bond is funded by a new property tax, at an estimated rate of 1.5 cents
per $100 in assessed property value. This replaces an expiring bond, so
property taxes shouldn't actually change on net. The projected average annual
revenue of this tax is $40MM.

Landlords will be allowed to pass through 50% of the new property tax to their
tenants.

## Why is it on the ballot?

Unlike [Prop A]({{< relref "/2020-march/san-francisco/propa/" >}}), this bond
must be on the ballot because it institutes a new property tax. All new taxes
must go to a publix vote due to [Prop 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13).
This requires a 2/3 majority to pass.
