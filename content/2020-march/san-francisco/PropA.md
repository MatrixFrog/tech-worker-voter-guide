position: "Yes"
short: "City College Bond to fund facilities construction & renovation"
---

## Vote YES

Bonds are among the best ways to finance public infrastructure because they let
the public build infrastructure now and pay for it with inflated dollars later.

This satisfies [#Taxation.Infrastructure]({{< relref "/framework" >}}#Taxation.Infrastructure)
from our voting framework.

## What is it?

This $845MM bond will be used by City College in the following ways:

* Seismic retrofit and other earthquake saftey
* Improved outdated electrical and plumbing infrastructure
* Repair buildings which leak or flood during heavy rain
* Replace failing infrastructure systems
* "Better prepare students for well-paid local science, technology and arts
  related jobs"
* Improve accessibility for students with disabilities

City College's facilities are in bad shape. 70% of the buildings at City
College's Ocean Campus have been rated "poor" or "very poor" for seismic
safety. Buildings flood, electrical and plumbing systems are old and
crumbling. In short, the condition of City College is shamefully bad.

This bond will give City College the capital it needs to fund these repairs
and renovations, ensuring the next several generations of students have
access to high-quality education in high-quality facilities.

and [Article XVI](https://ballotpedia.org/Article_XVI,_California_Constitution#Section_1)
