The tech industry has the ability to provide well paying jobs and
opportunities. As a former tech policy associate, and as someone who was born
and raised in The City, I always make it a point to ensure longtime San
Franciscans are included in employment opportunities at tech companies. We must
ensure that tech lifts all residents in San Francisco.
