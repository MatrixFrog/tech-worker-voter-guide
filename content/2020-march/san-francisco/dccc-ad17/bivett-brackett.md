In 2020, we should be making larger investments in our underserved communities
and connecting them to employment opportunities in tech.  The most economically
vulnerable San Franciscans continue to be young adults 17-30 years old who are
struggling to find employment pathways which pay a living wage and allow them
to afford a roof over their heads. It’s absolutely necessary that our local
Democratic Party is filled with members who can collaborate and bridge the gap
between these two communities and develop opportunities for partnerships not
further divide with harmful rhetoric.  What fuels this belief is watching
programs like Hidden Genius, BayCAT, Career Karma, and Blavity’s AfroTech
literally change low-income people’s lives!  It’s time to tech-together!
