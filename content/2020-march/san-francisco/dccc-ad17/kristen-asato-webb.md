As a daughter of a software engineer, I have long understood the value of
technology. It has revolutionized not only communication but every aspect of
the world around us. Advancements in medical technology have allowed for
noninvasive surgical procedures, biomechanical prosthetics and many other
innovations which have improved quality of life and life span. San Francisco
has evolved to be home to many businesses in the tech industry which has
brought great wealth but we need to work together to tackle the disparity that
has evolved along with it. San Francisco is facing many challenges including
becoming technically advanced itself. Priority needs to be placed on updating
technology across city departments, schools, libraries and community centers
because transparency, access and accountability is what is going to help
improve our city.
