We are well into the digital age, one of the biggest economic shifts in our
lifetimes, full of innovation and opportunity. I am a strong supporter of the
growing tech sector and want to work to ensure our policies will enhance this
fast growing field's ability to build a diverse workforce while also providing
equitable access for all residents.
