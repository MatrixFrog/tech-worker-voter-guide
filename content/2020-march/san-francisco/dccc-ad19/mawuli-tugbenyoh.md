Innovation is part of the fabric of San Francisco. Going back to the 1849 gold
rush, big thinkers with wild ideas have contributed to the significant economic
growth of our city. As a government policy professional, I have had the
opportunity to work with San Franciscans in the tech sector and to fight
against the inclination of some elected officials to stifle innovation that is
new and different. Strong participation in our elections makes our democracy
stronger, working collaboratively with San Franciscans in tech will make our
city stronger.
