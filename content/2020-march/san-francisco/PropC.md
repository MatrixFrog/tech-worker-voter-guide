## Vote YES

The Mayor and the Board of Supervisors are all in agreement that this should
pass.

It changes the dates of employment that qualifies employees of the Housing
Authority for retirement benefits.

## What is it?

This is the least interesting thing on the ballot. It is a minor administrative
change to set new dates for retirement benefit eligibility.

## Why is it on the ballot?

This is on the ballot because it is an amendment to the city charter. All
charter amendments must go to a vote of registered San Franciscan voters and
needs 50% + 1 votes to pass. That's reasonable for what is effectively a
constitutional amendment, but it's ridiculous for what this ballot prop
actually is.

This ballot prop highlights one of the truly inance things about the way San
Francisco is run.

San Francisco made the mistake of putting the qualifying dates for retirement
benefits in the charter, _and_ we gave an end date rather than a tenure
requirement. We're making the same mistake again.

Obviously, we would prefer that San Francisco fix the underlying dysfunction
that led to this situation, but we won't deny retirement benefits in the
meantime.
