Closely related to [#taxation.new-taxes](/frameworks/taxation/new-taxes/), but
this doesn't implement any new taxes. There's literally no reason a prop like
this ever needs to be on the ballot. The legislature (or Board of Supervisors)
already has the ability to fund programs during the budgeting process. When you
see something like this, it means they found a way to fund a pet project using
language they believe voters will like. We'll be stuck with that decision in
the next recession because this can only be changed with another popular vote.
