# Tech Worker's Voting Framework

The Tech Worker Voter Guide operates via a decision-making framework plus a
questionnaire for candidates.

We have a general voting framework for ballot props which works most of the
time. This framework was developed over several elections by several people,
and it is now fairly stable. Our framework and questionnaire are both open
source and we gladly accept pull requests.
