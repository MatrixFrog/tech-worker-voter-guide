Everyone deserve equality of opportunity, but that's not enough. To account
for historical wrongs and ongoing implicit bias, people from disadvantaged
backgrounds deserve an extra leg up.

People of color have endured over a century of explicitly racist federal and
state policies that have prevented them from building family wealth. Women
are still at a disadvantage compared to men in the workfore, though we have
made great strides in the tech industry towards equal pay for equal work.

Government ought to ensure that all of society prospers and builds wealth, not
a small subset of it.
