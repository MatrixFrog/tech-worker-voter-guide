America is a nation of immigrants. 70% of tech workers in the valley are
immigrants, and 50% in the SF/Oakland/Hawyard area are [source](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/01/17/h-1b-foreign-citizens-make-up-nearly-three-quarters-of-silicon-valley-tech-workforce-report-says/).
Immigration is a fundamental tenet of America.

Nationally, we have seen a rise of anti-immigration rhetoric and locally we
have seen the same. Immigrants are blamed for high housing costs, for traffic,
for crime. Yet immigrants are the least dangerous, most law-abiding
demographic.

We should do everything we can to make San Francisco an ideal place for
immigrants. That means valuing their voice and promoting policies which help
them come and stay here.
