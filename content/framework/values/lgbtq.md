All people, regardless of sexuality or gender identity, deserve equal treatment
under the law. To repair past injustices and to ameliorate ongoing injustice,
we should promote laws which protect and promote the rights of LGBTQ+ people.

Everyone has the right to be themselves and love whoever they like. You should
not fear retribution or alienation by your employer or your government.
