No one should go bankrupt due to unexpected medical problems. No one should
stay in a shitty job just to pay the bills. We need to provide a social safety
net so that people can take risks without ending up sleeping on the street.

Good social safety nets promote economic growth and ensure no one ends up
homeless. America, and San Francisco especially, do not have good systems in
place to help people. We need to do better.
